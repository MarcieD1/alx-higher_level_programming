# Integer Addition

This project includes a function that adds two integers. It takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which can be either integers or floats. If they are floats, they will be casted to integers before performing the addition. The function returns the sum of `a` and `b` as an integer.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.5
- pycodestyle 2.8.* (for code style checking)

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to execute the code:

This will run the main.py file, which contains an example usage of the `add_integer` function.

4. You can also run the code with your own inputs by modifying the arguments in the `add_integer` function call inside the `main.py` file.
