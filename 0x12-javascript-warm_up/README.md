- Create variables and constants
- Understand the differences between var, const, and let
- Identify and utilize different data types in JavaScript
- Use if and if...else statements for program flow control
- Add comments to your code for better understanding
- Assign values to variables
- Implement while and for loops for iteration
- Utilize break and continue statements for loop control
- Define and use functions in JavaScript
- Understand the return statement in functions
- Comprehend variable scope in JavaScript
- Apply arithmetic operators in JavaScript
